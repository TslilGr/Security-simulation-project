# Security-Simulation-Project

Implementation of simulation project in Omnet++, based on an article that shows a way to detect DDoS and Flash crowd attacks, using Entropy calculation and scoring method. In the process, we learned about the impact of the attacks on the network, and contradicted part of the results that the article showed.
